Description
-----------

Devhelp is a developer tool for browsing and searching API documentation.
It provides an easy way to navigate through libraries and to search by
function, struct, or macro.

The documentation must be installed locally, so an internet connection is
not needed to use Devhelp.

Devhelp works natively with GTK-Doc, so the GTK and GNOME libraries are
well supported. But other development platforms can be supported as well,
as long as the API documentation is available in HTML and a *.devhelp2
index file is generated.

Devhelp integrates with other applications such as Glade, Builder or
Anjuta, and plugins are available for different text editors (gedit, Vim,
Emacs, Geany, â€¦).

Integration with other developer tools
--------------------------------------

Devhelp provides some command line options, such as --search and
--search-assistant. A text editor plugin can for example launch the command
`devhelp --search function_name` when a keyboard shortcut is pressed, with the
function_name under the cursor.

Devhelp also provides a shared library, to integrate the GTK widgets inside an
IDE. It is used for example by Builder and Anjuta.

For the --search command line option, see the class description of
DhKeywordModel, the search string supports additional features useful for IDEs
or other developer tools.

How it finds the API documentation
----------------------------------

When you build (or install) a GNOME library, GTK-Doc will build an API
reference for you and install it into:

  $datadir/gtk-doc/html/$PACKAGE/

Along with the HTML files, a *.devhelp and/or *.devhelp2 index file is
also generated automatically. Thus Devhelp can simply scan that folder
for those index files and display the books they represent.

Devhelp uses the "XDG Base Directory Specification" to find
documentation. You can read more about that specification here:

  https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/

The list of locations searched for devhelp books is:

$XDG_DATA_HOME/devhelp/books
   e.g. ~/.local/share/devhelp/books/glib/glib.devhelp2
   or with Flatpak: ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Devhelp/data/devhelp/books/glib/glib.devhelp2

$XDG_DATA_HOME/gtk-doc/html
   e.g. ~/.local/share/gtk-doc/html/glib/glib.devhelp2
   or with Flatpak: ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Devhelp/data/gtk-doc/html/glib/glib.devhelp2

$XDG_DATA_DIRS/devhelp/books
   e.g. /usr/share/devhelp/books/glib/glib.devhelp2

$XDG_DATA_DIRS/gtk-doc/html
   e.g. /usr/share/gtk-doc/html/glib/glib.devhelp2

Note that the two latter consist of :-separated lists of directories to
look for. Those environment variables are normally set up by the
desktop environment or distribution.

Note that the name of the directory the *.devhelp2 file is in and the name of
the *.devhelp2 file (minus the extension) must match ("glib" in the above
examples).

The first version of the index file format (with the *.devhelp file
extension) is deprecated and its support will probably be removed in a
future version. You should use the second version, with the *.devhelp2
file extension.
