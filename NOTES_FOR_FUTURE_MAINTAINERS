Notes for future maintainers
============================

Normally all the codebase is in a good state, except DhAssistant because I
don't use it (and I think it's sometimes broken).

Some stuff that I was planning to do:

Improve DhBookList API
----------------------

Make it easier to create a custom DhBookList. Maybe expose publicly
DhBookListSimple and be able to subclass it.

Have man-pages for the lib C
----------------------------

https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=616509#c6

Create a software product line
------------------------------

By moving almost all the code to the libdevhelp (so the software product line
is implemented by developing a library, using classic OOP design patterns).

Same idea as Tepl, but applied to a smaller codebase. See:
https://developer.gnome.org/tepl/unstable/intro.html
https://www.amazon.com/Feature-Oriented-Software-Product-Lines-Implementation/dp/3642375200/

In Devhelp it's almost done. What remains is DhApplicationWindow, DhApplication
(see how it is done in Tepl) and a toolkit to build a preferences dialog (my
plan was to at least factor out a DhBookChooser widget from DhPreferences).

Then with the software product line, different API browser products can be
created: a generic one (same as current Devhelp), one specific for GNOME, etc.
See also the roadmap on the wiki.

Improve DhSettings
------------------

For the software product line, one thing that is not present in Tepl (so I
needed to do the first iteration in Devhelp), is DhSettings to handle the
GSettings in a library. The goal is of course to have the minimum amount of
code or work to do in the applications.

But I'm not entirely satisfied by the current DhSettings. But to make it better
it would require lots of boilerplate code, so I was maybe thinking about a code
generation tool that reads the GSettings XML schema and creates a GObject class
with some properties and functions for each key. Then DhSettings would come on
top of that generated class (either as a subclass or using it by composition)
to add more specific functions like is_book_enabled(), set_book_enabled(), etc.

The code generation tool would do something along those lines:
- Add a property of type GVariant for each GSettings key.
- Add getters/setters for the GVariant properties (bonus if for simple types
  like integers, strings, booleans, the getters/setters use the appropriate
  GLib type, not GVariant. Or find a way to make it convenient to use GVariant
  to get/set the properties).
- Add bind_to_key() functions, to bind a GVariant property to its corresponding
  GSettings key.
- For each key, add another property of type boolean to know whether the
  GVariant property has been bound to the GSettings key. Same name as the
  GVariant property, but with the -bound suffix.
- Add one bind() wrapper function with an API like g_settings_bind(), but calls
  g_object_bind_property() if -bound property is FALSE, and calls
  g_settings_bind() if -bound property is TRUE, to take advantage of the
  writability of the GSettings key.
- If more flexibility is needed, add getters to get the GSettings objects,
  those can be used for the keys where the -bound property is TRUE.
