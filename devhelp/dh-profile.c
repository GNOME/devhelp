/**
 * SECTION:dh-profile
 * @Title: DhProfile
 * @Short_description: libdevhelp profile
 *
 * #DhProfile permits to configure other libdevhelp objects. For example
 * #DhSidebar has the #DhSidebar:profile construct-only property. A #DhProfile
 * contains a #DhSettings object and a #DhBookList object. As a convention for
 * other libdevhelp classes that use #DhProfile, if the #DhProfile is not
 * provided (i.e. it is set to %NULL), then the default profile is used, see
 * dh_profile_get_default().
 *
 * There is the possibility to run in parallel multiple profiles in the same
 * process, for example:
 * - In an IDE for different projects or different programming languages.
 * - In different #GtkWindow's of the API browser application.
 *
 * With #DhSettings it's possible to share some #GSettings keys between
 * different profiles.
 *
 * A possible use-case is to have one "generic" profile, which corresponds to
 * the default profile as returned by dh_profile_get_default(). And another
 * profile tailored to a specific development platform (for example GNOME),
 * providing additional features useful for that development platform (for
 * example to download the latest API documentation, have a start page, etc).
