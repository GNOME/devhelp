/**

 * @Title: DhBookList
 * @Short_description: Base class for a list of #DhBook's
 *
 * #DhBookList is a base class for a list of #DhBook's.
 *
 * The default implementation maintains an internal #GList when books are added
 * and removed with the #DhBookList::add-book and #DhBookList::remove-book
 * signals, and returns that #GList in dh_book_list_get_books().
 *
 * The #DhBookList base class doesn't listen to the #DhBook #DhBook::deleted and
 * #DhBook::updated signals. It is for example handled by #DhBookListDirectory.
