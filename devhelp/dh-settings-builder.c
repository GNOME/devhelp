/**
 * SECTION:dh-settings-builder
 * @Title: DhSettingsBuilder
 * @Short_description: Builds #DhSettings objects
 *
 * #DhSettingsBuilder permits to build #DhSettings objects.
 *
 * The #GSettings schemas provided by the libdevhelp are relocatable. So the
 * paths need to be provided. If a path for a certain schema is not provided to
 * the #DhSettingsBuilder with the set function, the default path for that
 * schema will be used. The default paths are the paths common with the Devhelp
 * application.
 *
 * Why are the schemas relocatable? Because different major versions of
 * libdevhelp must be parallel-installable, so the schema IDs must necessarily
 * be different (they must contain the API/major version), but for users to not
 * lose all their settings when there is a new major version of libdevhelp, the
 * schemas – if still compatible – can be relocated to an old common path
 * (common to several major versions of libdevhelp or to an application). If a
 * schema becomes incompatible, the compatible keys can be migrated individually
 * with dconf (see the DhDconfMigration utility class in the libdevhelp source
 * code).

/* API design:
 *
 * It follows the builder pattern, see:
 * https://blogs.gnome.org/otte/2018/02/03/builders/
 * but it is implemented in a simpler way, to have less boilerplate.
