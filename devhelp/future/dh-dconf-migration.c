/* #DhDconfMigration is a utility class to copy the value of dconf keys from old
 * paths to new paths.
 *
 * You'll probably need to add a "migration-done" #GSettings key to know if the
 * migration has already been done or not (either with a boolean, or an integer
 * if you plan to have other migrations in the future).
 *
 * Use-case examples:
 * - When a project is renamed. The old #GSettings schema may no longer be
 *   installed, so it is not possible to use the #GSettings API to retrieve the
 *   values at the old locations. But the values are still stored in the dconf
 *   database.
 * - Be able to do refactorings in the #GSettings schema without users losing
 *   their settings when *upgrading* to a new version (doesn't work when
 *   downgrading).
 * - When a library uses #GSettings, with parallel-installability for different
 *   major versions, each major version provides a different #GSettings schema,
 *   but when upgrading to a new major version we don't want all the users to
 *   lose their settings. An alternative is for the library to install only
 *   relocatable schemas, relocated to an old common path (if all the keys of
 *   that schema are still compatible). When a schema (or sub-schema) becomes
 *   incompatible, the compatible keys can be migrated individually with
 *   #DhDconfMigration.
